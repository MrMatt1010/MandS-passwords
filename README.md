# M and S Passwords
Stand alone password manager that generates a secure password for you and saves it to a local file.
Once the password is generated it is sent directly to the computers clipboard for pasting into the password field 
in the site you are registering for or loggin into. 
After generating the password the software will ask you if the details are correct before saving them. 
You also have the choice of chosing your own password to be saved as well if you don't want a generated one.
